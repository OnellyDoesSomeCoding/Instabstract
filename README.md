# Instabstract

Instabstract is a Object Oriented Program that aims to create "modern art," If you've seen the internet recently, modern art has been filled to the brim with slop content, for example: Concetto spaziale, Attesse by Lucio Fontana, selling at a peak of 1.2 million US Dollar, which to a normal person, is extremely absurb and nonsensical. So, I had a thought, if these so-called artist could do it, how come--a normal person like me--couldn't.

This is the start of my project, Instabstract with 4 options to pick from. Imagination is the limit.

# Options

Randomly Generated Art with either Balls, Polygons, or even both, Randomly Generated Spiral with either Balls or Polygons, Randomly Generated Staircases with both Balls and Polygons, and--last but not least--Randomly Generated Firework, created with lines. You could pick the size, color, for both shapes, but sadly shapes are not changable the firework option.

The code itself doesn't need modification to work, but you could try modify it how you like. The options and features will be present after you run, asking for inputs.

# Classes

Balls() with size, color, filled parameters.
Polygons() with size, sides, color, filled parameters.
Spiral() with Balls() and Polygons() as its super class and an additional spiral parameters.
Stairs() with Balls() and Polygons() as its super class.
Firework() with thickness, color parameters.

# Notes

I give myself a 90 in Sophistication Level, because one of my major flaws in this project is not implementing physical parts of the program like instructed in class. Still, I hope you enjoy this project and maybe sell some of my "modern arts" for a few million dollar!
